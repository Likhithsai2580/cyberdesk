Understanding the core concepts of Cyberdesk will help you build more effective applications.

## Architecture Overview

Cyberdesk is built on a microservices architecture that provides scalable, reliable access to virtual desktop environments. The system consists of:

- **API Service**: RESTful endpoints for programmatic control
- **Desktop Pool**: Managed virtual desktop instances
- **Stream Service**: Real-time visual streaming of desktop environments
- **Authentication Service**: Secure API key management and validation
- **Database**: Persistent storage for desktop metadata and user information

## Desktop Instances

A desktop instance is a virtual desktop environment running in the cloud. Each instance:

- Has a unique identifier
- Runs in an isolated environment for security
- Can be controlled programmatically through the API
- Provides a stream URL for visual feedback
- Persists until explicitly stopped or times out
- Has configurable resources (CPU, memory, storage)

When creating a desktop instance, you can specify a custom timeout in milliseconds using the `timeoutMs` parameter. This allows you to control how long the desktop instance will remain active before being automatically terminated. If not specified, a default timeout of 1 hour (3,600,000 ms) is applied. For Pro users, a maximum of 24 hours (86,400,000 ms) is allowed.

## Computer Actions

Cyberdesk supports various computer actions to interact with the desktop:

### Mouse Actions

- `left_click`: Perform a left mouse click at specific coordinates
- `right_click`: Perform a right mouse click at specific coordinates
- `middle_click`: Perform a middle mouse click at specific coordinates
- `double_click`: Perform a double click at the current mouse position
- `scroll`: Scroll up or down by a specified amount
- `move_mouse`: Move the mouse cursor to specific coordinates
- `drag`: Drag from one point to another
- `mouse_press`: Press and hold a mouse button
- `mouse_release`: Release a previously pressed mouse button

### Keyboard Actions

- `write`: Type text into the desktop
- `press`: Press specific keys or key combinations

### Other Actions

- `wait`: Wait for a specified number of milliseconds
- `screenshot`: Capture the current state of the desktop and return the image data

## Bash Actions

Bash actions allow you to execute shell commands on the desktop instance. This is useful for:

- Installing software
- Running applications
- Manipulating files
- Executing scripts
- System configuration

The bash action endpoint accepts a `command` parameter containing the shell command to execute and returns the command output as a string.

## Desktop Streaming

Cyberdesk provides real-time streaming of desktop visuals through:

1. **Web-based Viewer**: Access the desktop through a browser using the provided stream URL
2. **VNC Protocol**: Connect to the desktop using standard VNC clients
3. **Embedded Iframe**: Embed the desktop view directly in your web applications

The streaming service uses WebRTC for low-latency, high-quality video transmission, making it suitable for real-time interaction.

## Authentication and Security

Cyberdesk uses API keys for authentication. Each API key:

- Is associated with a specific user account
- Has rate limits to prevent abuse
- Can be revoked or regenerated as needed
- Should be kept secure and not shared

All API requests must include the API key in the `x-api-key` header. Communication with the API is encrypted using TLS/SSL.

## Resource Management

Cyberdesk automatically manages resources to ensure efficient operation:

- Desktop instances are automatically cleaned up when stopped
- Inactive instances may be terminated after extended periods of inactivity
- Users are responsible for stopping instances when no longer needed to avoid unnecessary resource usage
- Resource quotas may apply depending on your subscription plan

## Error Handling

Cyberdesk API returns standard HTTP status codes and descriptive error messages:

- 200: Successful operation
- 400: Bad request (invalid parameters)
- 401: Unauthorized (invalid API key)
- 403: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- 404: Resource not found
- 409: Conflict
- 429: Rate limit exceeded
- 500: Server error

Each error response includes a message and a link to relevant documentation:

```json
{
  "error": true,
  "message": "Desktop instance not found",
  "code": "DESKTOP_NOT_FOUND",
  "documentation": "https://docs.cyberdesk.io/errors#DESKTOP_NOT_FOUND"
}
```

## Performance Considerations

When building applications with Cyberdesk, consider these performance best practices:

- **Minimize API Calls**: Batch operations when possible to reduce latency
- **Handle Timeouts**: Implement proper timeout handling for long-running operations
- **Optimize Image Processing**: When working with screenshots, consider compression and caching
- **Connection Management**: Maintain persistent connections when performing multiple actions
- **Error Retries**: Implement exponential backoff for retrying failed requests

## Billing and Usage

Cyberdesk billing is based on:

- **Active Desktop Time**: The duration desktop instances are running
- **API Calls**: The number of API requests made
- **Storage**: Any persistent storage used by desktop instances

Monitor your usage through the Cyberdesk dashboard to optimize costs and resource utilization.

Understanding the core concepts of Cyberdesk will help you build more effective applications.

## Architecture Overview

Cyberdesk is built on a microservices architecture that provides scalable, reliable access to virtual desktop environments. The system consists of:

- **API Service**: RESTful endpoints for programmatic control
- **Desktop Pool**: Managed virtual desktop instances
- **Stream Service**: Real-time visual streaming of desktop environments
- **Authentication Service**: Secure API key management and validation
- **Database**: Persistent storage for desktop metadata and user information

## Desktop Instances

A desktop instance is a virtual desktop environment running in the cloud. Each instance:

- Has a unique identifier (UUID format)
- Runs in an isolated environment for security
- Can be controlled programmatically through the API
- Provides a stream URL for visual feedback
- Persists until explicitly stopped or times out
- Has configurable resources (CPU, memory, storage)

When creating a desktop instance, you can specify a custom timeout in milliseconds using the `timeoutMs` parameter. This allows you to control how long the desktop instance will remain active before being automatically terminated. If not specified, a default timeout is applied (refer to API documentation for defaults). Check your plan for maximum allowed timeout values.

## Computer Actions

Cyberdesk supports various computer actions to interact with the desktop via the `/desktop/:id/computer-action` endpoint. Actions are specified using a `type` field and associated parameters:

### Mouse Actions

- **`click_mouse`**: Perform a mouse action (click, press down, or release up).
  - `x`, `y` (optional): Coordinates for the click.
  - `button` (optional): `left`, `right`, or `middle` (defaults to `left`).
  - `num_of_clicks` (optional): Number of clicks (defaults to 1, for `click_type: 'click'`).
  - `click_type` (optional): `click` (down and up), `down` (press), or `up` (release) (defaults to `click`).
- **`scroll`**: Scroll the mouse wheel.
  - `direction`: `up`, `down`, `left`, or `right`.
  - `amount`: Amount to scroll in pixels.
- **`move_mouse`**: Move the mouse cursor to specific coordinates.
  - `x`, `y`: Target coordinates.
- **`drag_mouse`**: Drag the mouse from a start point to an end point.
  - `start`: `{ x, y }` starting coordinates.
  - `end`: `{ x, y }` ending coordinates.

### Keyboard Actions

- **`type`**: Type text at the current cursor position.
  - `text`: The string to type.
- **`press_keys`**: Press, hold down, or release keyboard keys.
  - `keys`: A single key string (e.g., `'Enter'`) or an array of keys to press simultaneously (e.g., `['Control', 'c']`).
  - `key_action_type` (optional): `press` (down and up), `down` (hold), or `up` (release) (defaults to `press`).

### Other Actions

- **`wait`**: Pause execution for a specified duration.
  - `ms`: Time to wait in milliseconds.
- **`screenshot`**: Capture the current state of the desktop.
  - Returns a base64 encoded image string in the response (`image` field).
- **`get_cursor_position`**: Get the current mouse cursor coordinates.
  - Returns `{ x, y }` coordinates in the response (`cursorPosition` field).

## Bash Actions

Bash actions allow you to execute shell commands on the desktop instance via the `/desktop/:id/bash-action` endpoint. This is useful for:

- Installing software
- Running applications
- Manipulating files
- Executing scripts
- System configuration

The endpoint accepts a `command` parameter containing the shell command to execute and returns the command `output` (stdout/stderr) as a string in the response.

## Desktop Streaming

Cyberdesk provides real-time streaming of desktop visuals through:

1.  **Web-based Viewer**: Access the desktop through a browser using the provided `streamUrl` from the desktop creation response.
2.  **VNC Protocol**: The `streamUrl` often corresponds to a VNC-compatible endpoint (details may vary).
3.  **Embedded Iframe**: Embed the desktop view directly in your web applications using the `streamUrl`.

The streaming service aims for low-latency transmission suitable for real-time interaction.

## Authentication and Security

Cyberdesk uses API keys for authentication. Each API key:

- Is associated with a specific user account
- Has rate limits to prevent abuse
- Can be revoked or regenerated from your dashboard
- Must be kept secure and not shared publicly

All API requests must include the API key in the `x-api-key` header. Communication with the API is encrypted using TLS/SSL.

## Resource Management

Cyberdesk automatically manages resources:

- Desktop instances are cleaned up when stopped via the API or when they reach their timeout.
- Users are responsible for stopping instances when no longer needed to manage costs and resources.
- Resource quotas and limits may apply depending on your subscription plan.

## Error Handling

Cyberdesk API returns standard HTTP status codes and a simple JSON error message:

- 2xx: Successful operation
- 400: Bad Request (e.g., invalid parameters in the request body)
- 401: Unauthorized (e.g., missing or invalid API key)
- 403: Forbidden (e.g., attempting an action not allowed by your plan)
- 404: Not Found (e.g., desktop instance ID does not exist)
- 429: Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
- 5xx: Server Error (an issue occurred on the Cyberdesk side)

Error responses follow the `ErrorResponseSchema`:

```json
{
  "error": "Descriptive error message here. Example: Desktop instance a1b2c3d4-... not found"
}
```

Check the specific error message returned by the API for details on what went wrong.

## Performance Considerations

When building applications with Cyberdesk, consider:

- **API Call Latency**: Network latency will affect interaction speed.
- **Action Duration**: Some actions (like `wait` or long bash commands) take time.
- **Streaming Latency**: There will be some delay in the visual stream.
- **Error Retries**: Implement robust error handling, potentially with retries using exponential backoff for transient issues (like 5xx errors or rate limits).

## Billing and Usage

Cyberdesk billing is typically based on factors like:

- **Active Desktop Time**: The duration desktop instances are running (often billed per second or minute).
